# London_families_domestic_migration
Repository for files associated with analysis of domestic migration data for the London families and children project.  
Hopefully all the files needed to run the scripts are included in the DATA folder.   
If you find you need other data, please email me at Veronica.Tuffrey@london.gov.uk.

Note to VT on 30th October - created new repo in C/Families (instead of in migration_R folder)
